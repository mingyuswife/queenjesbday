Happy birthday, jes!!! with every sunrise, may you find your story unfold.<br>
With every sunset, may you find your song to relate.<br>
In the symphony of life, where we all belong,<br>  
And through every season that graces your way,  
I’ll always be there in all those seasons. The words I say now are what I'll say tomorrow, too.<br> 
 Maybe it sounds a bit cheesy, but you mean a lot to me.<br>
 I wish the best for you, and I try my best to express it.<br>

Happy birthday, Jes! On your special day, I want to remind you of something important: never feel like you have to carry the weight of the world on your own.<br>
 You have so many people who love and care for you deeply, including Jaehyun, who adores you endlessly.<br> 
Don’t bottle up your feelings—your emotions are valid, and sharing them only makes the bonds you’ve built stronger.<br>
 You deserve to feel heard, supported, and understood in every step of your journey.<br>
 Let today be a reminder to embrace the love around you and trust that you're never alone.<br>
